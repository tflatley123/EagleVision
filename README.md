# EagleVision
Eagle Vision is a Django-based web application designed to give students the ability to plan out their 4 year academic journey. A group project for CSCI3356 Software Engineering.

### Problem and Objective
Class registration is a complex and often stressful process for students, professors, and administration alike. One significant issue stems from an inefficient registration software service. Additionally, the current system does not adequately reflect student preferences, leading to a mismatch between course offerings and student desires. This disconnect results in some classes being oversubscribed and quickly filled, while others remain under-enrolled or even empty.
Eagle Vision aims to provide a service that facilitates more thoughful registration and course offerings. Eagle apps will provide a more intuitive interface and will provide necessary analytics for administration for planning courses in the future.
